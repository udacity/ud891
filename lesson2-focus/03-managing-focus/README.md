To run this example you'll need to use a local server. The easiest way to do
so is to use the [Web Server for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).

Make sure your settings look like this:

Under the heading that says "Web Server URL(s)" click the first link to preview
the app on your local server.

Take a look at the `scripts/main.js` file to figure out how the route is updated
and to determine when you would need to step in and manage focus.
