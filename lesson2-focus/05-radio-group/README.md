You can find the files for this example in the `lesson2-focus/05-radio-group`
directory.

Using the ARIA Authoring Best Practices doc (either
  [version 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) or [version 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/)) find the radio pattern
  and implement support for the `Down Arrow and Right Arrow` pattern.

**Note**: The 1.0 version of the doc refers to this as a "Radio Button" whereas
the 1.1 version of the doc refers to this as a "Radio Group".

You'll want to work in the `radiogroup.js` file to implement your keyboarding
support.
