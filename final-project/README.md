# Final Project

It's time to take the skills you've learned in this course and apply them to
a real project. We've gone ahead and created a very fancy looking site but
there are a number of accessibility issues that could be improved. Do your
best to fix as many as you can and if you get stuck or need a hint you can
check out the [answers file](ANSWERS.md) or the [full solution](https://github.com/udacity/ud891/tree/gh-pages/final-project/ecommerce-site/solution).

Accessibility is one of those things that you can always improve upon so it's
very possible you'll think up additions and solutions that even we didn't
cover in our final version. Have fun with it and see if you can build an
access that you think all of your users will love.
